### Introduction
I see Advent of Code as a great way to dive into a new language, [last year I tried it in C#](https://github.com/lyaneii/AoC2024) and it actually gave me a headstart on the job I was applying for.
 And now I am trying it in Java this year. One nice thing I found about this year's AoC is that the number of puzzles has been cut in half, so I am curious if the difficulty spikes much harder than before.

*Sidenote: learning java is also a way for me to possibly get into minecraft modding :D*

The custom http client I made follows the automation guidelines on the [/r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode) community wiki, link to the FAQ is -> [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/automation).
- The example input and real input are downloaded once, then stored locally in the resources folder.
- The inputs won't be requested again if they already exist in the resource folder.
- Even though the calls are manual, requests are throttled to once every 10 seconds as a small safety net.
