### Introduction
I see Advent of Code as a great way to dive into a new language, [last year I tried it in C#](https://github.com/lyaneii/AoC2024) and it actually gave me a headstart on the job I was applying for.
 And now I am trying it in Java this year. One nice thing I found about this year's AoC is that the number of puzzles has been cut in half, so I am curious if the difficulty spikes much harder than before.

*Sidenote: learning java is also a way for me to possibly get into minecraft modding :D*
